## Insights

Orders are highest on Friday/ Saturday evenings.

There are maximum orders from 12pm-1pm & after 4pm--8pm.

Classic Category contributes to maximum sales & total orders.

Large size pizza contribute to maximum sales.

The Classic Deluxe & Chicken pizzas are the sellers & revenue generators.
 
The Brie Carre is at the Bottom in both orders & revenue.

## Recommendation/Conclusion

I recommend that:

To maximize revenue and improve operational efficiency, the business should focus marketing efforts and resource allocation on Friday and Saturday evenings, especially during peak hours between 12 PM – 1 PM and 4 PM – 8 PM. Prioritize inventory and staffing around these time slots to meet high demand.

Given that the Classic category, especially Large-sized Classic Deluxe and Chicken pizzas, are the top performers in both sales and revenue, promotions and bundle deals should be centered around these items to further boost sales.

Additionally, consider re-evaluating or redesigning the Brie Carre pizza, as it ranks lowest in both orders and revenue. This could include adjusting the recipe, price point, or replacing it altogether with a more appealing option based on customer preferences.
